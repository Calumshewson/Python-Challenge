This is the completion of two seperate python challenges. 

In the first, PyBank, work was completed to analyze the contents of a budget kept in a csv file. 
The code presents the total number of months, total budget amount, average change between each month, and the greatest increase/decrease of money between months.
Additionally the code was written to store the results in a seperate .txt file.

In the second, PyPoll, a similiar goal was acheieved using different tactics to display election poll results.
The code tallies up the total votes.
It also sifts through to identify each candidate with votes, and tallies up their individual votes.
Finally it calculates the percentage of votes for each candidate and then based off the candidate with the most votes it finds the winner.
Once again, it also displays the results in a seperate .txt file

Lastly, I messed up with the commit messages, I am still new to github
